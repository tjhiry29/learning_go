Simple quiz program.
Reads in questions from problems.csv in form {question},{answer}
Asks questions up until 60 seconds or until all questions are answered.

A possible extension to do:
Command line arguments for CSV name and timer length

Is this the best way to do this? Weird goroutines everywhere?
